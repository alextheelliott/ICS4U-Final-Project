# Bookmark Manager

## Data Structure
- Our data will be stored in csv files 
- Each URL will have a topic/category associated (if no topic is specified a default one will be assigned)
- Each URL will also have a title associated with it. This can be set by the user or autofilled by the program

Example csv:
```
url,topic,title
```
